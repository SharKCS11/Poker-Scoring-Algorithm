Poker-Scoring-Algorithm
=======================

Better points system for a greater than six-handed poker tournament.
=======================
This poker scoring algorithm was created by adjusting the 9-6-3-1 ranking system for consistent play style.
Since most games occur with greater than six people, the rankings at the end of a session are alloted points as follows:
1st place- 9 points
2nd place- 6 points
3rd place- 3 points
4th place- 1 point
